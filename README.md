# Advanced-Machine-Learning

This is the repository with all three homeworks from the [Advanced Machine Learning](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/view-course-details/2019/29942/20200316152528/723f95b9-89b6-4236-b05a-dc63589c1ba1/a500adee-f644-4f22-a562-544f4cdeb70e/c3d38d43-56a5-49f3-ba4c-bcc2d983d37f/91ede065-977e-4fee-a05a-6c5f920cb33a) course.

These are HWs carried out in groups of 3 people, inside each folder there are:
  * the homework text
  * the report with the solutions
  * the entire code

# HW-1 (Image Filtering and Object Identification)

The main purpose of this homework is to understand the fundamental parts of image filtering and coding from scratch an object identification algorithm.

Keywords:
   * Image filtering
   * Gaussian filter
   * Histogram distances
   * Object identification

# HW-2 (Deep Neural Network and Backpropagation)

This homework allowed us to implement from scratch, both theoretically and practically, a Neural Network for the classification of images. It also allowed us to compare the results with a model from the PyTorch library.

Keywords:
  * CIFAR-10 dataset
  * Feedforward model
  * Backpropagation algorithm (gradient computation)
  * [SGD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) training
  * PyTorch

# HW-3 (Convolutional Neural Networks)
A convolutional neural network was implemented to perform image classification and explore
methods to improve training performance and the generalization of these networks.

Keywords:
  * CIFAR-10 dataset
  * PyTorch
  * Data agumentation
  * Early stopping
